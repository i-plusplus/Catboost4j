# CatBoost4j
[IMPORTANT : APIs is not final, current code is yet not released]

This is pure Java prediction client of Catboost Machine learning library. It works on json format of the model. You can save the model to json format using 

*model.save_model("file_name", format = "json", pool = pool)*

# This library is tested till catboost version '0.21'

# Code Documentation is available at http://parasmalik.blogspot.com/2020/07/explanation-of-json-model-format-of.html

# Current Limitations : 
 Currently this repository can predict only for regression problems. 

# Versioning 
 We will keep the major and minor versions same as catboost package. So, if this lib able to predict till catboost version 0.21 we will keep version as 0.21.x.x
